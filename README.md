# Jarsella E-Commerce Frontend

A responsive vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript e-commerce frontend.

## Project Structure

- **Core pages**: Landing page, products grid, and product detail
- **Category folders**: Each product category (Men, Women, Kids, Shoes, Jewelry) has its own dedicated folder for independent team development
- **Modular architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with global and category-specific styles/scripts

## Development

Each team member can work independently in their assigned category folder:

- `Landing page, and project structure : Diego Ar√©valo`
- `/categories/men/: Reynaldo Henriquez`
- `/categories/women/: Claudia Linares`
- `/categories/kids/: Jonatan Guevara`
- `/categories/shoes/ Monica Iglesias`
- `/categories/jewelry/ Andrea Raymundo`
